## What is funfunzmc?

funfunzmc was created due the lack of a functional backoffice generator in the NodeJS community.

The goal is to generate a fully automated backoffice that can be used to directly handle all the database data.

**Features:**
- CRUD operations
- Table search
- MySQL parser
- Friendly name generator for table names and fields
